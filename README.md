# masstrixR

Annotation of masses from non-targeted metabolomics experiments represents a first step towards metabolite identification. MassTRIX [1] was one of the first tools for the annotation of m/z values from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Different iterations of this tools have been published [1-3].

# Metabolite annotation in R

The newest version of MassTRIX enables annotatoin of m/z within R. Addtionally to matching of theoretical and measured m/z, searches in RT and CCS database are enabled.
